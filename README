Short description:
GarminPlugin is a browser plugin to support Garmin Devices on Linux.
Currently (02.12.2010) there is no official browser plugin support for Linux from Garmin.

This plugin has nothing to do with the company Garmin (http://www.garmin.com)

Long description:
This browser plugin has the same methods and properties as the official
Garmin Communicator Plugin (http://www8.garmin.com/products/communicator/).
It can be used to transfer GPX files (Geocache Descriptions) to your garmin
device using the official Garmin Javascript API. Its functionality depends on
the device you use.
- Edge305/Forerunner305: ReadFitnessData, ReadGpsData, No write support
- Edge705/Oregon/Dakota: ReadFitnessData, ReadGpsData, Write Gpx files
- Edge800: ReadFitnessData, Write Gpx/Tcx Files
- Other devices: Executes external command to write Gpx to device

Motivation:
Garmin introduced paperless geocaching a while ago on their devices. This
works great using Windows and geocaching.com because a windows plugin is
available that gives you the possibility to transfer geocaches with one click
to the device. Having to boot Windows every time I wanted to go geocaching
felt like a waste of time. I had many different ideas on how to best transfer
geocaches to my garmin device, but they were all based on parsing the
geocaching.com website because they do not offer an official API to access
the geocaches. The idea of having to update my application every time they
change their layout did stop me from going that approach. Writing a browser
plugin that simulates the garmin plugin seemed to be the best idea. Using a
javascript debugger soon revealed that the effort of writing such a plugin
wasn't that huge - so I got started...

Features:
  - Write a GPX file to disk
  - Call a script after the GPX file was written to disk
  - Read FitnessData from device
